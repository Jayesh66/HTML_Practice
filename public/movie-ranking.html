<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Many things made the Shawshank Redemption powerful - the impeccable plot, the story that manages to be both specific and universal, the agonizing injustice, the fact that nearly every character searches and finds their own definition of redemption</p>

<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>One of the best lessons that the film brought with it was to spread the importance of taking a break in life. The way Arjun, played by Hrithik Roshan has buried himself in a tough working schedule while chasing money takes a sharp turn as he goes on a road trip with two of his best friends.</p>

<h3>Persuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>Life is a struggle for single father Chris Gardner (Will Smith). Evicted from their apartment, he and his young son (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) find themselves alone with no place to go. Even though Chris eventually lands a job as an intern at a prestigious brokerage firm, the position pays no money. The pair must live in shelters and endure many hardships, but Chris refuses to give in to despair as he struggles to create a better life for himself and his son.</p>
